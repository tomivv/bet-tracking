# Bet tracking

### Collects basic information about bets with web interface and stores them to postgresql.
### Setting up
Refer to client and server folders for instructions.

### Information
The client is not necessary to the tracking but helps to visualize and add data to/from database.
You can modify the database and frontend to your own needs e.g. if you want to track some other information that I haven't added. There is currently only one site supported.
